This is a basic scraper to pull VFP articles from Doug Hennig's VFP development website (an excellent resource for all thing FoxPro and information that shouldn't be lost).
Pulls article title, description, publication date and places into a csv as an index (including pdf url and zip url).
Then downloads article PDF and places into folder 'pdfs' (if the pdf folder doesn't exist on local machine, code creates it).
Then downloads zip folders and places them into folder 'zip files' (if the 'zip files' doesn't exist on local machine, code creates it).
NOTE - downloaded zip folders are given same name as downloaded PDF file.
